# Useless_Website
This website has no point but to frustrate the user.

## About This Project
This useless websites goal is to frustrate the user. It asks the user on the main page if they would like to be Shrek's valentine and if the user clicks "Yes" it will switch pages to one where Shrek is looking forward to the date. If the user tries to select "No :c" the button will randomly move across the screen making it impossible to click no. If the user attempts this for around 5 minutes then the page will switch to one where it congratualtes the user on wasting 5 minutes of their life!
